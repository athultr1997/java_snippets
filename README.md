# Listings for Effective Java
This repository contains listings for the book Effective Java, 3rd Edition. They were made to demonstrate the principles described in the book as I worked along since reading the book without working code was not fun. The official one can be found here: [link](http://joshbloch.com/effectivejava) but it lacks completeness in some examples.
